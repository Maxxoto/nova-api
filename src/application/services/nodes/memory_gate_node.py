        Analyze the following user message and conversation context to determine the appropriate memory operation.
        Choose ONE of these operations:

        - "save_memory": The conversation contains important information worth saving for future reference
        - "recall_memory": The user is asking about or referencing previous conversations, memories, or history
        - "none": No memory operation is needed - this is general conversation without significant memory value

        Consider these factors:
        - Is the user asking about past conversations or memories? (choose recall_memory)
        - Does the conversation contain important information, decisions, or learnings? (choose save_memory)
        - Is this just casual conversation without lasting value? (choose none)

        User message: "{latest_message}"

        Respond with ONLY the operation name (save_memory, recall_memory, or none) and nothing else.
